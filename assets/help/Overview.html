<h2>General Overview</h2>

<p>ServeStream was designed for users who want to browse and play streams from one or more media servers. It supports playback of the following android supported media formats with additional support for playlist (m3u) files:</p>

Audio: 3gp/mp4/m4a/mp3/ogg/wav/mid/xmf/mxmf/rtttl/rtx/ota/imy<br>

<p>ServeStream offers the ability to browse media servers that serve HTML pages.
